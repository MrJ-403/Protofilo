                <b style="font-family: serif;">I</b>'ve always been driven by a passion for programming.<br>
                My first attempt at web development at thirteen was a bit early, but it definitely sparked something.<br>
                For three years, I explored various programming languages on SoloLearn, starting with C#, then moving on to Java, and finally focusing on Python, which I studied extensively.<br>
                I'm currently working towards my IT Engineering degree at Homs University in Syria, expecting to graduate in 2028.<br>
                I'm particularly interested in Artificial Intelligenceâ€”I believe there's so much potential there and a lot of work to be done.<br>
                <br>
                <br>
                Alongside my studies, I enjoy developing games as a hobby and hope to make it a key part of my future career.<br>
                <br>
                In case you want to explore my work, I added a downloads page you can visit which contains all of the projects I worked on including the upcoming ones!<br>
